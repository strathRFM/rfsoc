RTL-SDR:

To use the RTL-SDR in Python the following library is needed: pyrtlsdr. The library can be installed using the following pip command:

**pip install pyrtlsdr**

Once downloaded the python package requires some dependices called librtlsdr, to work correctly. The package can be accessed from here https://github.com/librtlsdr/librtlsdr/releases. 
We used **rtlsdr-bin-w64_dlldep.zip** package.

Extract the zip and save it within a working directory. We commonly used our C drive.
