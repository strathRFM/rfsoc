    "## Motivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Motivation: The Radio Frequency (RF) Spectrum has been under increasing pressure in recent years due to a demand for data capacity and bandwidth increasing. The spectrum is a limited resource due to the fact a given space in the spectrum can only be utilised by  one user at a time to prevent inter-channel interference (ICI). Spectrum allocation across the world is primary organised by a countries government, where portions of the spectrum are allocated for specific uses e.g. military or portions can be auctioned. This process allows no ICI to take place but means the spectrum allocation is inefficient due to the users not always utilising the allocated spectrum. This means the allocated space has become static.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description:\n",
    "strathRFM is a system that can generate datasets of the RF spectrum and map it using the easy to use GUI. The generated dataset will be of sigMF format as in the description of the README file. The currently supported devices are: rtl-sdr, rfsoc 2x2, rfsoc 4x2, ZCU111\n",
